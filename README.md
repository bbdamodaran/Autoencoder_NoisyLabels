# Autoencoder_NoisyLabels
This repository contains the Keras code of supervised and unsupervised branch of autoencoder to avoid overfitting deep neural networks to the noisy labels. The idea is inspired from the semi-supervised learning framework

To see how the loss is implemented, please refer to 'models.py'
